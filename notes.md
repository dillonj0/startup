Basically, every time I work on my startup I should begin with
```
git pull
(... make changes to the code)
git add *
git commit -m "<some description>"
git push
```
and I'm going to want to commit new changes several times per project and per workday so I can show my progress and save my edits in case I blow it and have to go back in time etc.

### _12/JAN/2024
HTML - Elements in the webpage
CSS - Layout & styling
JavaScript - Script monitoring the 
Service - What you're giving the client
Database/Login - Persisted app and auth data
WebSocket - Data pushed from server, chat
React - Web framework

_If I do the dice game that Max and Emily taught us, we would..._
_...use HTML & CSS to design the UI._
_...use JavaScript to actually run the game etc._
_...allow users to connect to the game._
_...require users to create some account before they can play, though they could maybe see scores beforehand._
_...use WebSockets to pass signals between the dealer and the players._
_...use React for whatever React does?_
