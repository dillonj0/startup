This text was included to _show_ that I have a rudamentary understanding of markdown

### _11/JAN/2024_
Basically, every time I work on my startup I should begin with
```
git pull
(... make changes to the code)
git add *
git commit -m "<some description>"
git push
```
and I'm going to want to commit new changes several times per project and per workday so I can show my progress and save my edits in case I blow it and have to go back in time etc.
